# CPE301-Final-Lab
Authors: Alex Medal and Ankush Joshi
## Abstract 

The goal of this lab is to design and implement a functional swamp cooler system to gain a better understanding of how temperature regulation occurs in different environments. The circuit design for this project integrates a lot of different components such as a sensor for detecting the water level, the DHT11 humidity sensor, as well as the temperature sensor. We also included things such as UI elements such as the LCD display, and buttons in conjunction with designated LEDS. We also made use of actuators such as the DC motor and Adafruit Gear-Reduced Stepper Motor. Finally, all of this came together with the Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller which essentially controlled and brought all the elements together to actually perform and execute certain tasks.
